# Data Science Projects
### General Assembly Part Time Data Science 2021

This repository contains three projects that I completed as part of the General Assembly part time data science course in 2021.

## Unit 1: Python Challenges
The first project is a Jupyter notebook containing several Python challenges that I completed as part of the course. These challenges include basic syntax exercises, string manipulation, loops, and conditional statements. The notebook serves as a good reference for anyone looking to improve their Python skills.

## Unit 2: Exploratory Data Analysis with IMBD Data
The second project is a Jupyter notebook that explores the exploratory data analysis stage of a data science project. The notebook uses IMBD data to demonstrate techniques for exploring and visualizing data, identifying outliers, and handling missing values. The notebook also provides insights on how to use correlation analysis to identify relationships between variables.

## Unit 3: Linear Regression and KNN
The third project is a Jupyter notebook that runs through linear regression and KNN algorithms. The notebook covers concepts such as data normalization, model evaluation, and cross-validation. The notebook also includes datasets and code for running both algorithms and analyzing the results.

Overall, these projects provide a good overview of the data science skills and techniques that I learned during the General Assembly part time data science course. Each project includes detailed explanations, code examples, and datasets for readers to use and reference.
